                HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the
                combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is
                used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to
                annotate (at the note for computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most
                of the markup (e.g. HTML) languages are human readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be
                done on the text. It is used for structuring and presenting the content on the web pages. HTML5 is the fifth version
                of HTML. Many elements are removed or modified from HTML5.<br>

                HTML code instructs web browsers how to render content. It explains the underlying structure of a web page. For decades,
                HTML has been considered a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web along with Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, and

                As its name implies, HTML isn’t technically a programming language; it’s a markup language used to organize data from
                the Internet. HTML documents are composed of HTML elements represented by tags, which are written inside angle brackets,
                to categorize content. An example of the HTML structure to display a simple “Hello World” message would look like this:
